					<p>Two girls, a sunday afternoon and a lot of time in hand.
						Now, that means some serious fashion in the making, doesn't it?
						How can it even be anything else! Especially when they're bored
						out of their wits with their respective high-profile PR jobs.
						Yup,that's us, Urmi Daga and Hemal Ved. So we did the inevitable
						and gave in to that ultimate seduction. Fashion. It's the dope we
						yearn for and the money we always blew up for...</p>

					<p>But it just doesn't end here. It took us one and half year,
						as stylists, to work with some of the finest people in the
						industry; Having assisted for magazines like Filmfare, FHM, People
						and having shot with celebrities like Sonakshi Sinha, Kunal Roy
						Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Prateik Babbar, Shahzahn Padamsee, Milan
						Lutharia, Sonu Sood, Eesha Koppikhar etc we are now ready to enter
						the blogging zone. But we're not here to mother you or to burden
						you with gazillion different pieces of advice on hardcore style
						and fashion. You know your stuff better than we do! But if it's
						fine tuning you're looking for, you've come on the right page.</p>
					<span>Non-fiction shows</span>
					<p>WWH started off with styling anchors like Karan Singh
						Grover, Gaurav Kapoor, Ranvijay, Vj Bani, Pravesh Rana, Raghu and
						Rajiv for Roadies, Vj Aliyah, Natasha Suri for non-fiction shows
						on GEC channels namely, UTV, MTV and Channel V. Styling singers
						and music producers like Amit Trivedi, Clinton, Karsh Kale, Vishal
						Dadlani etc for Coke Studio @ MTV.</p>
					<span>Advertisements,Promos,Photoshoots</span>
					<p>Shifting on to something that we enjoy doing the most, some
						more work by WWH is as follows: Birla Sunlife, Parker, Mc Donalds,
						Ultratech, Gadget Guru, Kelloggs, Movers & Shakers, Indian Idol,
						KFC, Alto, Pizza Hut, Kara, Honda, JK Cement, Lookbook shoot for
						Pepperfry.com, Photoshoots with photographers like Ram Bherwani,
						Munna S, Suresh Natrajan, Gaurav Sawn, Rohan Shreshtha, Taras
						Taraporvala, Avinash Gowariker etc.</p>

					<span>Personal Shopping</span>
					<p>You can completely imagine having your own personal shopper.
						WWH helps you research the shops for you, based on your style,
						budget, and lifestyle, understand and learn about your body shape
						and the styles that would suit you. We make you simplify your
						everyday dressing by helping you cleanse your wardrobe, add on
						must-haves and subtract unsuitable items, making space for some
						new styles.</p>


					<p>So now it doesn't take rocket science to figure what's on
						our agenda, does it? We breathe anything that's everything under
						the fashion umbrella, even if that means the business of fashion.
						So this is where the 'F' word is no taboo, where a 'size zero'
						shouldn't intimidate you and where hi-end luxurious brands are not
						recommended, just like your fashion magazines do, and rip your
						pockets apart. We'll be your daily wardrobes and virtual stylistsâ€¦
						read on!</p>
